# Hospital-Emergency-Room-DashBoard

**Project Overview:**
The Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard provides data-driven insights to improve emergency room (ER) operations, optimize resource allocation, and enhance patient care. Using Power BI, this project visualizes key performance indicators (KPIs), patient demographics, wait times, and referral patterns to identify bottlenecks and improve efficiency in ER management.

**Key Features:**
- **Interactive Dashboards:** Four detailed dashboards (Monthly View, Consolidated View, Patient Details, and Key Takeaways).
- **KPI Tracking:** Monitors patient volume, wait times, satisfaction scores, and department referrals.
- **Trend Analysis:** Identifies peak hours, seasonal variations, and operational inefficiencies.
- **Data-Driven Insights:** Helps hospital administrators make informed decisions for improving patient flow and care quality.

**Dashboards Overview:**
1. **Dashboard 1: Monthly View:**  Tracks patient admissions, age distribution, referrals, and wait times over a month to identify trends.
2. **Dashboard 2: Consolidated View:** Provides a summarized analysis of ER performance over a selected date range.
3. **Dashboard 3: Patient Details:** Displays individual patient records, including demographics, wait times, and referral status.
4. **Dashboard 4: Key Takeaways:** Highlights key insights, patterns, and recommendations for improving ER efficiency.

**Tools & Technologies Used:**
- Power BI â€“ For interactive visualizations and reporting.
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) â€“ For calculated measures and insights.
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib) â€“ For initial data analysis and cleaning.
- Excel â€“ For preliminary data manipulation.

**Conclusion:**
This project leverages Power BI and data analytics to revolutionize hospital emergency room management. By visualizing real-time patient inflow, wait times, and resource utilization, hospitals can improve efficiency, enhance patient care, and optimize decision-making. ðŸš‘ðŸ“Š
